My name is Dwayne and I'm 25 years old, currently living in Manchester, England, I work as a bartender at the Stock Exchange Hotel and my goal is to change my career and join the IT industry. 
This is a place where I will store each coding session I do, while on my path to becoming an entry-level developer. 
I will also keep track of certain useful stats, for the sake of measurement, and also because I love personalised analytics. 
My coding journey started on the 11/07/2023, after I got made redundant from my sales job. 
Since that date I've been using an app called "Forest", which tracks the amount of time you spent on a given task, providing a visual of a plant, or tree, which you plant every time you use the built-in timer. 
As of 01/02/2024, I have accumulated 7,436 minutes, or 123.93 hours of coding time. 

My longest uninterrupted streak of coding days is currently 7 days (and counting). 
My longest study time in a single day is 176 minutes. (3hrs)  
My longest study time in a single week is currently 617 minutes. (10.5hrs)
My longest total study time in a single month is 2167 minutes. (36hrs)
