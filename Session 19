//Study Time: 92 minutes.
//Have kept studying throughout the last week, just never uploaded, because of time constraints, but managed to complete a challenge webpage, will I upload shortly. 
//Examples of code, I wrote today: 

function openOrSenior(data){
  const output = [];
for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
  const member = data[i];
  const age = member[0]; 
  const handicap = member[1];
  
  if (age >= 55 && handicap > 7 ) {
    output.push('Senior')
  } else (output.push('Open'));
}
  return output; 
}

function openOrSenior(data){
  const output = [];
for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
  const [age, handicap] = data[i];
  age >= 55 && handicap > 7 ? output.push('Senior') : output.push('Open');
}
  return output; 
}
